# JavaScript Sign Up Page

## Background
This week I learned about Javascript event handlers, functions, and Regular Expressions so I decided to make this sign up form utilizing all 3 concepts.


## Requirements
* Form has to be responsive
* All inputs must include Regex test with indicators of success and fail
* When user clicks 'submit' button there will be some feedback
