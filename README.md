# JavaScript SignUp Form

## Description
This is a responsive signup form that allows user's to input a first name, last name, email address, and password. The form will also provide real time feedback on whether the inputs are accepted or if there is an error. The user will not be able to submit the form until all errors have been addressed.

## Goal
The goal of this project was to get a better understanding of JavaScript event handlers, functions, and Regular Expressions. I wanted to be able to take a user's input and run it again some RegEx testing and provide real time feedback to the user.
